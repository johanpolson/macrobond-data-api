    "\n",
    "Here we can see how the get_unified_series method eases workflows by simply querying the data needed in the model, applying the transformations and visualising the results, rather than doing a one-off mathematical transformation from scratch. Not only this feature saves a lot of time in the preparatory work but it also increases consistency across the various time series and models running off the back of the Macrobond data.  "
