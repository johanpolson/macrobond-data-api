So, in order for us to make the data comparable, we will utilise the 'Fetchallunifiedseries' endpoint which utilises a post request, which takes the following form below, let's see what each of these mean and how it can manipulate our data."

Not only this feature saves a lot of time in the preparatory and necessary work but it also increases consistency across the various time series and models running off the back of the Macrobond data.
