    "# 5.1 - Macrobond Data API for Python - Using the Macrobond Tree Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "*Retrieving information from the Macrobond Tree Structure*\n",
    "Note that the Tree Structure is subject to frequent evolution. Hence, it is not recommended using hardcoded parts of the tree to build and update your universe on production. The methods below can be mostly used for data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to act as a template and guidline in which certain elements can be minipulated to get the desired outcome. Here we demonstrate how you can use the Macrobond Data API for Python to locate a Time Series in the Macrobond's proprietary Tree Structure - used across various Macrobond's products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series have been grouped and organized into a tree-structure by Macrobond. They feature thousands of primary sources from around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**National & International Databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "For these databases, we have reproduced the original source structure and classification in the application and web API. For the most part, these databases are from international sources that provide harmonized data across countries. However, we have chosen to reproduce the structure of certain primary sources, as well. Youâ€™ll find the datasets typically cover most, if not all, the data available from the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you wish to locate a Time Series within the Tree Structure, there are three database entry points in which the Time Series can be found:\n",
    "- Concept & Category\n",
    "- Country & Region\n",
    "- Source & Release\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some Time Series can be found in all 3 entry points while others can be found in one or two of them only. A Time Series that carries a RegionKey will be present under Concept & Category for instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Country & Region**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the three main entry points, the structure is organized according to a different principle, for example Country and Region, which is what you wouldd use if want to look at a variety of data for a particular country.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source & Release**\n",
    "\n",
    "For finding data from a specific source, choose the Source & Release view, especially if you are familiar with the way the source organizes its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept & Category**\n",
    "If you are looking for one indicator to compare across several countries, unemployment for example, the Concept & Category view is the place to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a full description of all methods and parameters used in the examples in the [documentation of the API](https://macrobond.github.io/macrobond-data-api/common/api.html).\n",
